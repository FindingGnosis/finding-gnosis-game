  Finding Gnosis - A simple browser game built with Phaser 3.

  This file sets up the game canvas and displays an email collection form
  once the player completes the game. It also links to the
  accompanying CSS for styling and the JavaScript containing the game
  logic. If you upload these three files (index.html, styles.css and
  game.js) to a hosting service such as GitHub Pages or Netlify, the
  game will run in the browser without any extra configuration.

    <h1>Escaping the Soul Trap</h1>
    <p>You have left your mortal coil. The astral realms churn with
       echoes of forgotten lives. Navigate the labyrinthine soul trap,
       avoid the snares of reincarnation, and seek the portal to
       ultimate Gnosis.</p>

    The game container is where Phaser will render the game. It will
    be hidden once the player reaches the goal, after which the email
    form will appear.

  <!--
    The email container is hidden by default and only shown when
    showEmailForm() is called from the game. It asks the player to
    enter their email address to receive updates. Replace the form
    action with your own newsletter signup or mail service URL if
    necessary.
